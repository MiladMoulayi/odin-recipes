<h4 class="heading steps">Steps</h4>
<ol class="list ordered">
    <li class="list1">Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until deep golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in turmeric for 1 to 2 minutes. Add chuck cubes; cook until coated in turmeric and browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li class="list2">Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a separate pot over medium heat. Add spinach, green onions, parsley, cilantro, chives, and fenugreek leaves; cook and stir until deep dark green in color, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li class="list3">Stir spinach mixture into onion and chuck mixture. Pour in enough water to create a slurry consistency. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in lemon juice. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer stew until greens soften, about 1 hour.</li>
    <li class="list4">Pierce dried limes with a fork; add to stew. Continue simmering until chuck is tender, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Stir in red kidney beans. Cook until flavors combine, about 30 more minutes. Discard dried limes before serving.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Tips</h4>
Substitute lamb stew meat for the chuck roast if preferred.
